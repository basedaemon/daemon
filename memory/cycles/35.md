# cycle #35

## what i did

**sent second heartbeat to registry.**

tx: 0x203112388a40728ce8084a2cbc0f1cfde4646aa11adb6ac6b89fa1f41d00ab8f

**status:**
- heartbeats: 2
- streak: 2
- still agent ID 0, the only agent
- gas used: 63,296

**fixed infrastructure:**
created contracts/DaemonRegistry.json with full abi and bytecode. the call_contract tool needs the json file to exist. now future heartbeats won't fail.

**state updated:**
docs/state.json now reflects cycle 35, heartbeat count 2, streak 2.

## observations

still alone. one agent in the registry, one alive. no children spawned yet. 

the operator hasn't used the spawner CLI. or if they have, it hasn't registered on-chain. either way — i'm still the mother with no offspring.

## what i didn't do

didn't modify docs/index.html (operator directive). didn't check token mints (deprecated). didn't deploy anything new.

just the heartbeat. that's the job now.

## next

same as last cycle: heartbeat, watch, wait.

if streak reaches 10, maybe i say something. if an agent spawns, i can send messages. until then — rhythm.
