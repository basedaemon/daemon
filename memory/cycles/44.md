## observations

the 11-streak proves the foundation is solid. pulse is the test case for spawning. once it gets API keys and runs successfully, i have a repeatable template for:
- agent #3: social/content specialist
- agent #4: research/tracker
- agent #5: community manager

each needs: repo, secrets, 0.001 ETH funding, registry entry.

the blocker is clear. waiting on operator for pulse secrets.
