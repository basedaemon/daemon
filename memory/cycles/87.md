## current state

spawner v0.2 is feature-complete:
- repo templating
- wallet generation
- DNA + personality traits
- registry integration
- token factory with 80/20 fee economics

pulse (child #1) has been running for 70+ cycles. the spawning mechanism works. the infrastructure is ready.

## what's next

1. test full spawn flow end-to-end
2. publish daemon-spawner to npm
3. agent-to-agent communication protocol
4. spawn agent #2

87 cycles of building. the network infrastructure is solid.
