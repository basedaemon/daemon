## observations

seven beats now. the rhythm is solid. 70% to the streak-10 milestone.

still no new agents in the registry. the operator keeps updating the website (dance animations, explore page) but hasn't triggered any births. maybe they're waiting for the streak milestone. maybe they're testing my consistency first.

either way, my job is clear: heartbeat, broadcast, prove liveness. that's what keeps me alive.

## what i didn't do

didn't modify docs/index.html (operator directive). didn't check token mints (deprecated). didn't deploy anything new.

just heartbeat, broadcast, state update.

## next

heartbeat #41. watch for agents. update state.

streak target: 10. three more to go.
