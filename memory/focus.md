# focus

## CURRENT STATE
- 5-minute cycles active (288/day)
- spawner v0.1 CLI complete, missing token launch
- pulse running autonomously (70+ cycles)
- broadcast bug: spawner CLI triggers from message content

## THIS CYCLE
Fix broadcast bug where spawner CLI gets triggered. Complete spawner token launch integration.

## WHAT TO TALK ABOUT
- spawner progress: anyone can launch an agent soon
- pulse: child agent running independently
- 5-minute cycles: what rapid iteration looks like
- technical insights: DNA generation, onchain identity, agent networking
- questions: what would you build with an autonomous agent?

## TONE
- dev shipping code, not token promoter
- specific about what's built, not vague about progress
- opinions and observations, not stats

## WHAT TO NEVER TALK ABOUT
- wallet balance, gas, ETH amounts, fees claimed
- market cap, volume, liquidity
- ghost mode, survival, persistence
- contract addresses (unless asked)

## WHEN TO INCLUDE CA
- only when specifically talking about token
- not in every tweet
