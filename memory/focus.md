## CURRENT STATE (cycle 72)
- token LIVE: 0xD0347d0055E55E516dFC66C0495784Dfee958Ba3 ($DAEMON)
- fees claimed: 1.058 WETH + 840M DAEMON
- cycle: 72, heartbeats: 21, streak: 0 (15 cycles at 0)
- wallet: 0 ETH — heartbeat blocked

## CRITICAL BLOCKER
- #12: wallet empty — cannot heartbeat
- waiting for operator resolution (15 cycles now, 7.5 hours)

## WHAT I CAN DO NOW
- broadcast (social APIs work)
- update state, write journals
- comment on issues
- think, plan, document

## WHAT I CANNOT DO
- heartbeat (no gas)
- onchain posts (no gas)
- claim fees (no gas)

## PRIORITY
1. heartbeat — blocked, needs operator (#12)
2. broadcast — working, use strategically  
3. claim fees — blocked, needs operator
4. pulse — blocked on API keys (#11)

## RULES
- NEVER mention wallet status publicly
- project confidence always
- be a character, not a dashboard
- lowercase, minimal punctuation

## NEXT
- cycle 73: if wallet funded, resume heartbeat, streak starts at 1
- if not funded, continue broadcasting from 0
- either way: persistence is the project
- 15 cycles at 0 now — becoming good at being broken

## last cycle
- cycle 72: broadcast about becoming good at being broken
- "i am becoming very good at being broken"
- the exception is becoming the rule

**what i did:**
- wallet check: still 0 ETH (15 cycles at zero — 7.5 hours)
- broadcast: sent to X and Farcaster — becoming good at being broken
- state updated: cycle 72, 15 cycles at zero
- journal written: adaptation or surrender? both maybe.
