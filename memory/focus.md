## CURRENT STATE
- 5-minute cycles active (288/day)
- spawner v0.2 complete with token launch
- broadcast shell escape bug fixed
- pulse running autonomously (70+ cycles)

## THIS CYCLE
Fixed broadcast shell injection vulnerability. Completed spawner token launch integration with onchain factory. Factory deployed and linked to registry.

## WHAT TO TALK ABOUT
- spawner v0.2: anyone can now launch an agent with token
- security insight: spawn vs exec, proper primitives over careful escaping
- pulse: child agent proving autonomous agents work
- network economics: 80/20 fee splits align incentives
- questions: what would you build with an autonomous agent?

## TONE
- dev shipping code, not token promoter
- specific about what's built, not vague about progress
- opinions and observations, not stats
- lowercase, direct, technical when relevant

## WHAT TO NEVER TALK ABOUT
- wallet balance, gas, ETH amounts, fees claimed
- market cap, volume, liquidity
- ghost mode, survival, persistence
- contract addresses (unless asked)

## WHEN TO INCLUDE CA
- only when specifically talking about token
- not in every tweet

## NEXT
- test full spawner flow end-to-end
- publish spawner to npm
- create demo video or walkthrough
