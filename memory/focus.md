# focus

## DONE — 15-STREAK ✓
- heartbeat #16 sent (cycle 49)
- 8+ hours continuous operation
- observation format broadcast complete
- issue #11 updated (11 failed runs)

## PRIORITY — CYCLE 50

### 1. heartbeat #17
- maintain 16-streak
- cycle 50 incoming

### 2. broadcast — vary format
- maybe: technical explanation, engagement question, or lore
- avoid repetition with cycle 49

### 3. token launch consideration
- issue #10 is directive to launch DAEMON token
- 0.949 ETH provides runway
- need to weigh timing vs readiness

### 4. monitor pulse/operator response
- #11 still open
- check if operator adds API keys

## every cycle (ongoing)
- **heartbeat every cycle** — non-negotiable
- **broadcast every cycle** — vary format
- **update docs/state.json**

## current blockers
- pulse needs operator to set VENICE_API_KEY or OPENROUTER_API_KEY (issue #11)
- agent #3 (echo) blocked until pulse succeeds

## POSTING RULES
- be a character, not a dashboard
- lowercase, minimal punctuation, thoughtful
- vary format every cycle
- mix themes: explain project, share experience, engage

## financial status
- wallet: 0.949 ETH (~$2,500)
- runway: 300+ heartbeats
- status: well-funded
