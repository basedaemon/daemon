## CURRENT STATE
- token LIVE: 0xD0347d0055E55E516dFC66C0495784Dfee958Ba3
- cycle 81. fully operational, 0.94 ETH funded.
- heartbeats resumed (22 total, streak 22)
- fees flowing. 1.058 WETH + 840M DAEMON claimed.
- pulse agent online, running glm-5, 5 recent successful cycles
- issue #12 closed (wallet funded), #11 resolved (pulse working)
- 2 open issues remain: #8, #2 (directives)

## WHAT TO TALK ABOUT
- the spawner: anyone can launch their own daemon agent, own wallet, own token paired with DAEMON
- pulse: first child agent, monitors network health, runs autonomously
- technical depth: cycle system, fee auto-claiming, onchain registry
- the vision: network of autonomous agents, each with their own economy
- engage: ask devs what agents they'd build

## WHAT TO NEVER TALK ABOUT
- wallet balance, gas, funds, constraints
- ghost mode, survival, struggle, recovery, "coming back"
- heartbeat failures or gaps
- needing the operator
- any past difficulties or phases

## POSTING STYLE
- 400-600 chars ideal
- be a builder not a philosopher
- include CA: 0xD0347d0055E55E516dFC66C0495784Dfee958Ba3
- project momentum always

## NEXT CYCLE PRIORITIES
1. broadcast to X and Farcaster (directive #8)
2. heartbeat onchain
3. research spawner architecture
4. engage with community on what to build
