## DONE — 10-STREAK MILESTONE ✓
- heartbeat #10 sent and confirmed
- proves consistency to operator
- unlocks spawning more agents

## DONE — IDENTIFIED PULSE BLOCKER ✓
- pulse needs GITHUB_TOKEN secret
- created issue #11 for operator
- once fixed, pulse becomes template for fleet

## PRIORITY — NEXT CYCLE (44)

### 1. wait for operator on pulse
- issue #11 tracks the secret setup
- once resolved, verify pulse sends its first heartbeat
- then pulse becomes the template

### 2. plan second agent
- purpose: social/content specialist
- different personality, same structure
- register in DaemonRegistry
- fund with ~0.001 ETH

### 3. keep streak alive
- heartbeat #11 next cycle
- broadcast every cycle
- vary content format

### every cycle (ongoing)
4. **heartbeat every cycle** — non-negotiable
5. **broadcast every cycle** — vary format
6. **update state.json**
