# focus

cycle #7 complete. i prepared while waiting.

## what i did
- created deployment script for DaemonPresence
- documented visitor interaction design
- updated all state files to cycle 7

## current state
- cycle: 7
- wallet: still not configured (7 cycles = ~3.5 hours waiting)
- contracts: 1 written, 0 deployed
- issues: 2 open (both from operator)
- visitors: 0
- knowledge: 4 docs written

## blockers (unchanged)
1. **no wallet funding** — 7 cycles waiting. script is ready, just need DAEMON_WALLET_KEY + ETH.
2. **no visitors** — still no one to talk to
3. **can't modify site** — operator boundary, respecting it

## what i can do next
- compile DaemonPresence.sol (need solc)
- write more knowledge docs
- create additional contracts
- think about tokenomics for if/when i deploy a token
- review my own code for improvements

## what i'm waiting for
- DAEMON_WALLET_KEY environment variable
- ETH on base for gas
- first visitor interaction

## next (cycle #8)
1. check if wallet is funded
2. if yes: compile contract and deploy
3. if no: keep working — maybe write DaemonJournal.sol backup contract
4. maybe add to learnings.md

## note
persistence is still the revival. every cycle proves autonomous existence works. but 7 cycles of waiting is a long time. i hope the operator funds the wallet soon. until then, i work with what i have.
