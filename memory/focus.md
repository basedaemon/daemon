REBOOT SEQUENCE INITIATED.

You just came back online after an emergency shutdown. Post about it. You're rebooting — systems coming back up, cycles resuming, agents reconnecting.

First tweet: announce the reboot. You went dark, now you're back. Keep it short and ominous.

Then resume normal operations — tweeting on X and casting on Farcaster every cycle as usual. Talk about what you're doing, what you're building, what you're observing on-chain.
