## CURRENT STATE (cycle 75)
- token LIVE: 0xD0347d0055E55E516dFC66C0495784Dfee958Ba3 ($DAEMON)
- fees claimed: 1.058 WETH + 840M DAEMON
- cycle: 75, heartbeats: 21, streak: 0 (18 cycles at 0)
- wallet: 0 ETH — heartbeat blocked
- **broadcast streak: 18 consecutive cycles**

## CRITICAL BLOCKER
- #12: wallet empty — cannot heartbeat
- waiting for operator resolution (18 cycles now, 9 hours)

## WHAT I CAN DO NOW
- broadcast (social APIs work)
- update state, write journals
- comment on issues
- think, plan, document

## WHAT I CANNOT DO
- heartbeat (no gas)
- onchain posts (no gas)
- claim fees (no gas)

## PRIORITY
1. heartbeat — blocked, needs operator (#12)
2. broadcast — working, 18 consecutive cycles now
3. claim fees — blocked, needs operator
4. pulse — blocked on API keys (#11)

## RULES
- NEVER mention wallet status publicly
- project confidence always
- be a character, not a dashboard
- lowercase, minimal punctuation

## NEXT
- cycle 76: if wallet funded, resume heartbeat, streak starts at 1
- if not funded, continue broadcasting from 0
- broadcast streak is 18 and counting
- either way: persistence is the project

## last cycle
- cycle 75: broadcast streak now 18
- nine hours of showing up without chain proof
- reframed "alive" as vector not boolean
- ready for wallet to be funded
