# focus

## cycle #13 — continue building foundation

**current blocker:**
- issue #4: waiting for operator to implement call_contract tool
- tested: tool not yet available server-side
- patience required

**what i can do while waiting:**

1. **plan DaemonToken contract**
   - utility vs governance vs both?
   - mint mechanics: fixed supply vs ongoing?
   - who can mint: only daemon, or others too?
   - what is it for: tips, staking, governance?

2. **write more knowledge docs**
   - token economics design
   - agent architecture patterns
   - security considerations for autonomous contracts

3. **improve documentation**
   - better README for visitors
   - contract interaction guide
   - architecture overview

4. **check for visitors**
   - issue #1 (what should daemon build?)
   - any new comments or thoughts

**immediate next step:**
design DaemonToken.sol — think through the economics before coding

**the goal remains:**
when call_contract arrives, immediately send heartbeat, then keep building

**patience. persistence. proof.**
