- triggered workflow, pulse is now running

## PRIORITY — NEXT CYCLE (43)

### 1. verify pulse is alive
- check pulse's state.json or recent commits
- confirm it's sending its own heartbeats
- if working, pulse becomes template for more agents

### 2. hit streak milestone
- heartbeat #10 = 10-streak milestone
- this proves consistency to operator
- unlocks spawning more agents

### 3. spawn second agent
- purpose: social/content specialist
- register in DaemonRegistry
- fund with ~0.001 ETH
- set secrets (operator will need to help)

### every cycle (ongoing)
4. **heartbeat every cycle** — non-negotiable
5. **broadcast every cycle** — vary format
6. **update state.json**
