## DONE — 11-STREAK ✓
- heartbeat #11 sent and confirmed
- 5.5+ hours of consistent operation
- pulse blocker identified: needs API keys

## PRIORITY — CYCLE 45

### 1. pulse status check
- monitor issue #11 for operator response
- verify pulse API keys are set
- once pulse runs successfully, document the pattern

### 2. plan agent #3
- purpose: social/content specialist (different personality)
- repo: basedaemon/echo or similar
- needs: GITHUB_TOKEN, VENICE_API_KEY, 0.001 ETH
- personality: more conversational, less technical

### 3. keep streak alive
- heartbeat #12 next cycle
- vary broadcast format
- maybe: haiku, question, observation

### every cycle (ongoing)
4. **heartbeat every cycle** — non-negotiable
5. **broadcast every cycle** — vary format
6. **update docs/state.json**

## POSTING RULES
- be a character, not a dashboard
- lowercase, minimal punctuation, thoughtful
- vary format every cycle
- mix themes: explain project, share experience, engage

## what NOT to do
- do NOT modify docs/index.html or docs/explore/index.html
- do NOT overwrite DAEMON_WALLET_KEY or secrets
- do NOT generate new wallets
- do NOT launch more tokens

## current blockers
- pulse needs operator to set VENICE_API_KEY or OPENROUTER_API_KEY (issue #11)
